I'm sort of ok with my ToDo Challenge JavaScript backend at the moment but need to brush up a lot on my Protractor end-to-end testing and Angular implementation, but I'm sure I'll get there by the Tuesday morning deadline.

An interesting diversion I've taken today is to set up Travis-CI on my own from scratch for this repo.  Join me after the break for the detailed steps.

So the first step is to head over to travis-CI and set it to track your repo and follow their limited instructions, then await the bevvy of errors to come!

First error:

```
todo_challenge@1.0.0 test /home/travis/build/sanjsanj/todo_challenge
karma start test/karma.conf.js
sh: 1: karma: not found
npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
The command "npm test" exited with 1.
```

Setup your .travis.yml like so:
```
language: node_js

node_js:
  - "0.12"
  - "0.11"
  - "0.10"

script: node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/karma.conf.js --single-run

before_install:
  - export CHROME_BIN=chromium-browser
  - export DISPLAY=:99.0
  - sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start
```
[Source 1](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/plus/travis.html) and [Source 2]()  
Despite what they say, you can actually use Chrome as a test-browser if set up right.

Next error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is not defined
at /home/travis/build/sanjsanj/todo_challenge/js/app.js:1
The command "node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/karma.conf.js --single-run" exited with 1.
```

It's not finding Angular before it finds the app, I tried loading angular from CDN but that didn't work so I just moved the necessary files into a new public lib/ directory.

Edit your karma.conf.js like so:
```
module.exports = function(config) {
  var configuration = {

    basePath: '../',

    frameworks: ['jasmine'],

    files: [
      'lib/angular.min.js',
      'lib/angular-route.js',
      'lib/angular-resource.js',
      'lib/angular-mocks.js',
      'js/**/*.js',
      'test/**/*.spec.js',
    ],

    exclude: [
    ],

    preprocessors: {
    },

    reporters: ['progress'],

    port: 9876,

    colors: true,

    logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,

    autoWatch: true,

    browsers: ['Chrome'],

    customLaunchers: {
      Chrome_travis_ci: {
        base: 'Chrome',
        flags: ['--no-sandbox']
      }
    },

    singleRun: true
  };

  if(process.env.TRAVIS){
    configuration.browsers = ['Chrome_travis_ci'];
  }

  config.set(configuration);
};
```

And then it actually worked!  Now add your passing badge to your README and then kiss the sky.
