Here we are at last!  We had an 8.30am meet up time at Makers HQ where we could have breakfast and socialise with our fellow cohort.  Kick-off was at 9.30am, we got to meet the team and each other.  The rest of the day was about setting the stage for the 12 weeks to come.

We were given some very big-picture talks about how to approach learning, coding, communicating, having a great time and also looking after ourselves physically and mentally.  Everyone is so nice, so approachable and so damn qualified.  This might be heaven.
