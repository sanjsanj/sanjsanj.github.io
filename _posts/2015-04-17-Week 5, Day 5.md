The seniors finished off and presented their final projects today and the place was absolutely packed to the rafters with friends, family, alumni and hiring partners.  
Their work inspired awe and dread in us, it is very hard to believe that we'll be in their position just 6 short weeks from now.  Much work still needs to be done.

I didn't get enough done today, the atmosphere was definitely jubilant and celebratory but we did discuss in our standups what people wanted to do next week during lab week and some interesting ideas were thrown out.  
A few of the themes were consolidation, catching-up and completion but personally I feel like I'd like to make a game.  
If I'm feeling brave I might go with Javascript since that's something I need more practice with but I think I may fall back on using something like Unity or Unreal.
