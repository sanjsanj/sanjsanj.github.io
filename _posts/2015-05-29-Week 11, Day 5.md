It's here at last.  D-day.  We finish off our projects and present them to a packed room this evening.  I've never been so nervous in my whole life.

I honestly don't know how I got through it but I did, our team did and our entire cohort did.  Some excellent work has been done in the last fortnight and there were a lot of excellent projects presented and great work done by all.
