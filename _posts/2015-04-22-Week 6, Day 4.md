Paired up with a new partner today and finished off the front end implementation of their Chitter Challenge remake in JavaScript.  
There was heavy use of JQuery and lots of test coverage, of course.  It was very interesting to see how they had gone pretty deep into APIs to create a very lightweight and modular server and client.

The first part of the morning was all about tidying up the code and teasing out some added functionality, then we moved on to prototyping in PhotoShop then implementing in HTML and CSS.

The more I learn about CSS the more I know I don't know.  It's a fascinating and intriguing language, but definitely a dark art.  
I'm getting the hang of a lot of it's features but centering and positiong things still seems very hit and miss.  

Tomorrow I intend to re-do my Bowling challenge so it might be tight, but if I can then I'll squeeze in another CSS project to round the week off.
