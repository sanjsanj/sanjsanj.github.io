Woke up a new man today!  Totally rested and regenerated, and I think it shows.  Have managed to finish the barebones of the weekend Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge today and intend to spend tomorrow styling it nicely with CSS.  
Looking at it now it's hard for me to believe that I was staring at a blank page this morning and I'm pretty proud of what I've achieved.  It still needs lots of extra features but the foundations are there and I'm confident they're strong.  
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'sinatra/base'
require_relative 'lib/cpu'
require_relative 'lib/decide'

class RPS < Sinatra::Base
  enable :sessions
  cpu = CPU.new
  decide = Decide.new
  set :views, Proc.new { File.join(root, "views") }

  get '/' do
    erb :index
  end

  get '/game' do
    redirect '/'
  end

  post '/game' do
    if params[:Choice]
      @p1_choice = params[:Choice]
      @p2_choice = cpu.choice
      @decision = decide.make @p1_choice, @p2_choice
      erb :result
    else
      session[:Name] = params[:Name] if params[:Name]
      erb :game
    end
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
{% endhighlight %} 

Above is my server file, really simple but does the job.  Join me after the break for some more snippets.
