Last night I went to bed extremely unhappy with my code.  I even had to [ask for help on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30018580/how-to-let-an-ng-repeat-list-item-have-its-own-button-and-checkbox).  As I lay in bed I began to wonder if there could be a better way.

And sure enough there was!  More after the break.

I refactored the living daylights out of my code, trimming every ounce of fat away and can happily say I have something to be proud of.  Unfortunately, I didn't get my protractor end-to-end tests working but that's just something I'll have to discuss with my coach in code review tomorrow.

```javascript
toDoList.controller('ToDoListController', [function(){
  var self = this;

  self.itemList = [];
  self.view = 1;

  self.addItem = function(){
    self.itemList.push({'name': self.newItem, 'isCompleted': false});
    self.newItem = '';
  };

  self.clearCompleted = function(){
    self.itemList = self.itemList.filter(function(item){
      return !item.isCompleted;
    });
  };

  self.setView = function(selection){
    self.view = selection;
  };

  self.isView = function(selection){
    return self.view === selection;
  };
}]);
```

You should've seen the spaghetti that was my first version, in fact you can on my Git if you go back a few commits on master.
