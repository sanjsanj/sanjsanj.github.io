After the long weekend we were back at the Makers Academy today.  It's amazing how tightly bonded I feel to many of my co-coders, I was really glad to see them again.  And to get on with the serious business of designing a database in PostgreSQL.  

The interface leaves a lot to be desired but it's effective, that's for sure.  The practical project we're building to hone our skills on is a bookmark manager, allowing us to Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete entries (CRUD).  We're also building a web interface for it so that should give us some more CSS experience.

List of databases
Name             |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges
------------------------------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
bookmark_manager_development | sanjsanj | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
bookmark_manager_test        | sanjsanj | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
postgres                     | sanjsanj | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
sanjsanj                     | sanjsanj | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 |
```

Apparently by the end of the week we'll know what the hell any of this is supposed to mean.
