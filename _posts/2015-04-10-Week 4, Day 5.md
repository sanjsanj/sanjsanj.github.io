As per usual we were assigned our latest weekend challenge and it is to create a Twitter clone, aptly titled Chitter.  
This will tie in all our practice this week working with databases and creating a full-stack with Ruby and Sinatra.  
And, as usual, it is all Test-Driven Development with BDD Rspec.  We were given the option of using Rspec or Cucumber, and as much as I love Cucumber I think I'll go with Rspec for this one, with Capybara providing excellent website testing semantics.  

>Tests provide the only reliable documentation of design.  The story they tell remains true long after paper documents become obsolete and human memory fails.

The Friday vibe at Makers Academy is typical of new tech companies and probably most companies in London, pretty relaxed and people start breaking out the beers and wine early in the afternoon.  
My tolerance has fallen drastically recently so I'm on the train, feeling slightly tipsy, after just two beers.  So, I'll leave that at that and try and enjoy my ride home.  Bon soir!
