Had my code review today for the Ruby BDD airport-challenge and I'm pretty pleased about it.  My new coach is not known for handing out complements so in light of that I think I can breathe a sigh of relief.  I am very glad I actually spent Sunday night revamping my tests and code, had I not done that today would have had a very different outcome.
>> Hey, Sorry to be quite harsh. Despite what it sounds like this is really good. You just need to neaten it up a bit and it would be perfect. I'm impressed with some of your code but just try to make sure that everything is consitant (sic) and has purpose. Really good :checkered_flag:
Just a short post from me tonight, I need to fix my code!
