Started the weekend Bowling Scoresheet challenge late last night but when I carried on with it today I had major issues getting it to elegantly calculate the final score for a game.  So I went back to the drawing board and scoured the web for design ideas.  By the end of the day I was passing the basic requirements of the challenge and feeling confident about getting a web interface up and running so I could do some CSS.  
One of the issues I faced was getting a concise way to re-run commands in tests.  In ruby you can just use .times but we don't have that luxury in JavaScript.  

```javascript
bowling.roll(10);
bowling.roll(10);
bowling.roll(10);
bowling.roll(10);
bowling.roll(10);
bowling.roll(10);

...or...

function helper(rolls, pinsEachRoll){
  for (var i = 0; i < rolls; i ++){
    bowling.roll(pinsEachRoll);
  };
};

helper(6, 10);
```

Above:  How to create a helper function to create multiple actions, replicating .times in Ruby.
