Another athletic restart on our Battleships challenge today.  As usual, all goes well, my pair programming partner today and I had paired before on the precourse on a test-driven development exercise so we totally meshed, supporting and urging eachother on.  She's just as laid back as me so it was a very pleasant day but we did get a lot done.  Our coach has been doing incremental tutorials on how to make Battleships in Ruby testing with Rspec so we decided to follow those, pausing at key moments to see if we could write and solve the tests he suggested for ourselves.  
The day ended with our wellness guru taking us to the pub for drinks.

*(Here's some of our cohort outside Makers Academy before heading off to the pub)*  
If you're really interested, there's some code after the break!

Below is the test code to create some behaviour-driven testing scenarios for our game board, ultimately this could be modified to conform to any board-game.  The application code to pass those tests is underneath it:  
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'board'

describe 'Board' do

  let(:cell){ double :first_cell }
  let(:second_cell){ double :second_cell }
  let(:cell_class) { double :cell_class, new: cell }
  let(:board) { Board.new({ size: 100, cell: cell_class })}
  let(:ship) { double :ship, size: 2 }
  let(:small_ship) { double :ship, size: 1 }


  it 'has 100 cells in the grid' do
    expect(board.grid.count).to eq 100
  end

  it 'can place a ship' do
    board.grid[:A1] = second_cell
    expect(second_cell).to receive(:content=).with small_ship
    board.place small_ship, :A1
  end

  it 'can place a size 2 ship on the grid' do
    board.grid[:A1] = second_cell
    board.grid[:A2] = second_cell
    expect(second_cell).to receive(:content=).with(ship).exactly(2).times
    board.place ship, :A1
  end

  it 'can work out the coordinates for a size' do
    expect(board.coords_for(2, :A1, :hor)).to eq [:A1, :A2]
  end

  it 'can place a size 2 ship on the grid vertically' do
    board.grid[:A1] = second_cell
    board.grid[:B1] = second_cell
    expect(second_cell).to receive(:content=).with(ship).exactly(2).times
    board.place ship, :A1, :vert
  end

  it 'knows if a coordinate is on the board' do
    expect(board.coord_on_board?(:A1)).to be true
  end

  it 'knows if a coordinate is not on the board' do
    expect(board.coord_on_board?(:A11)).to be false
    expect(board.coord_on_board?(:K1)).to be false
  end

  it 'cannot place a ship outside of the board' do
    expect { board.place ship, :A10 }.to raise_error 'Ship out of bounds'
  end

  it 'can hit items on the board' do
    board.grid[:A1] = second_cell
    allow(second_cell).to receive(:content).and_return ship
    expect(ship).to receive(:hit)
    board.hit(:A1)
  end

  it "can't hit a cell outside of the boundaries" do
  end
end

You may wonder why so much of an emphasis on testing.  Without stringent and well thought out tests your chances of writing agile, lean code that will allow future coders to understand and modify it to meet the needs of the future are slim to none.  
Below:  Application code:  
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class Board
  DEFAULT_SIZE = 1
  attr_reader :grid

  def initialize options
    size = options.fetch(:size, DEFAULT_SIZE)
    cell = options.fetch(:cell)
    @grid = {}
    letter_range_based_on_size(size).map do |letter|
      (1..dimension_size(size)).map{ |number| @grid["#{ letter }#{ number }".to_sym] = cell.new }
    end
  end

  def dimension_size size
    Math.sqrt(size).ceil
  end

  def letter_range_based_on_size size
    ('A'..to_letter_in_alphabet(dimension_size(size)))
  end

  def to_letter_in_alphabet number
    (number.ord + 64).chr
  end

  def place(ship, coord, orientation = :hor)
    fail 'Ship out of bounds' unless coords_for(ship.size, coord, orientation).all? { |coord| coord_on_board? coord }
    coords_for(ship.size, coord, orientation).each do |coord|
      grid[coord].content = ship
    end
  end

  def coords_for size, coord, orientation
    coords = [coord]
    (size - 1).times { coords << next_coord(coords.last, orientation) }
    coords
  end

  def next_coord coord, orientation
    orientation == :hor ? coord.next : coord.to_s.reverse.next.reverse.to_sym
  end

  def coord_on_board? coord
    grid.keys.include? coord
  end

  def hit cell
    grid[cell].content.hit
  end
end
