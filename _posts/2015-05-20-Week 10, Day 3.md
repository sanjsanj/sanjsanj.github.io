Yesterday we managed to get our Github signin working using the Omniauth gem and today we spent the first half of the day experimenting with setups to mock the authentication properly in our tests.

Ultimately we ended up following the procedure laid out in [this doc](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Integration-Testing) to mock our signin and it worked just fine.

Our tests have a lot of repetition so we will be refactoring to helpers to make it more readable and user-friendly.

We also had a bit of a journey of exploration with ERB, creating custom setups for our form fields and url links stemming from their entries.  We initially had troubles creating clickable links to entered URLs then [followed the examples here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16721816/how-do-i-defined-a-variable-link-to-to-an-external-url) to get it working.

Basically we had to replace the text_field property in our form to be a url_field and then in ERB `link_to site.url, url_for(site.url)`
