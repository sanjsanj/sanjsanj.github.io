This week I've decided to focus on CSS to reinforce some front-end stuff while I still have the time.  My partner and I took a version of the Thermostat challenge that he and someone else did last week and styled it up!

Post-modern and functional, move over Tracey Emin.

Going to do some more CSS work on various other projects this week and also re-do for my Bowling challenge, and while I'm at it I might as well re-do the entire challenge.
