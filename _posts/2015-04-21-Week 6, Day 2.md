This week I've decided to focus on CSS to reinforce some front-end stuff while I still have the time.  My partner and I took a version of the Thermostat challenge that he and someone else did last week and styled it up!

[Use the Thermostat web app on Heroku](https://sleepy-hamlet-6933.herokuapp.com/)

Post-modern and functional, move over Tracey Emin.

The final hurdle to this challenge was getting it up on Heroku.  I didn't want to use Node.js simply for that so a bit of searching turned this up:

>Rename your index.html to home.html or something similar.  
Create an index.php file with the following code:

```<?php include_once("home.html"); ?>```

>Thatâ€™s it!

Going to do some more CSS work on various other projects this week and also re-do for my Bowling challenge, and while I'm at it I might as well re-do the entire challenge.
