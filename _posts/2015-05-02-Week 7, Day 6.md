I started off the day by realising I need to learn a lot more before I can do this challenge justice.  I can highly recommend [The Angular Intro on Codeschool](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro), it's a concise video series with practical challenges to complete and it taught me a lot about the fundamentals.

A couple of other resources I would recommend are the [Kapeli Dash docs](https://kapeli.com/dash) which are an excellent set of docs for most popular languages and the [multitude of YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=angularjs).
