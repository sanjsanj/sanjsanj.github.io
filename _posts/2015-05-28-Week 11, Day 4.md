Last leg of our final projects and things are heating up.  After the break some tittle tattle on Github authentication and jumbotrons.

We had to have Github sign in and to check membership of the Makers Academy organization to grant entry to the juicy goodness inside.  This required the use (and prerequisite testing) of Devise for user management, Omniauth for Github authentication and Octokit to check membership of Makers.

These tools are excellent and I don't know where we would be without them but they come with a warning label.  They are not always ready to go out of the box and need a lot of customization and troubleshooting.  And testing is the other issue, or rather, challenge that we overcame, drenched in blood, sweat and tears of the binary nature.

Also, I love jumbotrons.
