Added some additional back-end logic and went through my code making it more descriptive and readable.  I had hoped to split the functions out of the main JavaScript file into modules but since I'm only using 3 functions in my object I was advised to leave them there but DRY it up a bit.

I continue to enjoy CSS and am glad I spent my week on that, a lot of people in the cohort felt they didn't get enough out of this week and I think it may be because their goals were too large or unwieldy.  Definitely pick small projects you can probably finish in a day and work towards learning new skills with each one.
