Yesterday I did an athletic restart of the Thermostat Javascript challenge back-end and today my new partner and I decided to carry on and finish the full-stack off.  Perfect timing because our talks today were about how to properly test Jquery with Jasmine and also a pretty in-depth talk about CSS.  
Until now I was completely unsure about deploying JS to the web but not only did we test-drive JQ creation but also deployed and began styling in CSS.

```javascript
describe('Interface', function() {

  beforeEach(function(){
    jasmine.getFixtures().fixturesPath = '.';
    loadFixtures('index.html');
  });

  it('displays default temp', function(){
    expect('#temp').toContainText('20');
  });

  it('displays power saving mode on by default', function(){
    expect('#psStatus').toBeChecked();
  });

  it('can increase temp by 1', function(){
    $("#up").click();
    expect('#temp').toContainText('21');
  });

  it('can decrease temp by 1', function(){
    $('#down').click();
    expect('#temp').toContainText('19');
  });

});
```

A small sample of our interface tests.
