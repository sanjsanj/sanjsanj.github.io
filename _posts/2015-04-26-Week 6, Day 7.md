I had a beautiful lie in this morning after going out for a drink with a friend last night and I feel awesome.  I could have had another go at the Bowling Challenge but I don't really have the mental energy at the moment and want to rest up for a tough JavaScript week to come.  
I did, however, spend the morning on a lovely farm in Essex and intend to whitter away the rest of Sunday playing Counter-Strike:Global Offensive and getting wasted.
