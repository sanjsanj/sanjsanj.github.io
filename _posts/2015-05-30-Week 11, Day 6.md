I think the best I can do today is deliver a post-mortem for the after-graduation events of last night.  It was an amazing day at Makers and it deserved an even more excellent night out on the town, and it certainly got that.

You can imagine how much steam we had to let off and we really did get an opportunity to do that.  We partied at Makers into the early evening and then headed down the street to our local watering hole.

I think Makers made up more than half of the patrons there, seniors, juniors, graduates, coaches, friends, families and more.  After quenching our thirst there we headed to a famous nearby pizzeria for more revelry, and then back to the pub!

I was exhausted and left around midnight but I was in the minority, most other people carried on well beyond that, and they deserved it.
