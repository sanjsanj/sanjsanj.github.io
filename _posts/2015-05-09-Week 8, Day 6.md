I present to you the chronicle of my troubleshooting for the weekend challenge, Instagram clone in Ruby on Rails using Rspec for testing.  Warning: This is a 'no such thing as stupid questions' zone!

<!--more-->

I've decided to start my testing/coding with uploading an aimage description first and because of how I wrote my test I had to remind myself of how to make button text in erb.

```ruby
scenario 'prompts user to enter a description, then displays the new description' do
  visit '/images'
  click_link 'Upload Image'
  fill_in 'Description', with: 'My face'
  click_button 'Upload'
  expect(page).to have_content 'My face'
  expect(current_path).to eq '/images'
end
```
```
<%= form_for Image.new do |i| %>
  <%= i.label :description %>
  <%= i.text_field :description %>
  <%= i.submit "Upload" %>
<% end %>
```
