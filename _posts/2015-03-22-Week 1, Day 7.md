Work continues on the Airport Challenge.  I'm mostly happy with my first iteration and could probably go to my code review tomorrow morning with it, if I have time tonight I'll start from scratch and try and do it better/cleaner.
The lesson I want to share today is about decoding the Rspec error to find the offending line of code in Ruby.
Below is my code causing a `Runtime_error`, join me after the break to see how I finally troubleshot it.
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'airport'

feature 'Grand Finale' do
  airport = Airport.new
  planes = []
  6.times { planes << Plane.new }
  p = Plane.new

  scenario '6 planes can be created' do
    expect(planes.length).to eq 6
  end

  scenario '6 planes can land' do
    planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 6
  end

  scenario 'plane is denied landing permission when airport is full' do
    planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }
    ## the above line is the trouble-maker
    expect { (airport.landing_permission p).to raise_error 'permission denied' }
  end

  scenario '6 landed planes have status: landed' do
    airport.landed_planes.each do |plane|
      expect(plane.status).to eq 'landed'
    end
  end

  scenario 'after all 6 planes takeoff there are no more landed planes' do
    planes.each do |plane|
      airport.order_plane_to_takeoff plane
    end
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 0
  end

  scenario 'after all 6 planes takeoff their status is \'flying\'' do
    planes.each do |plane|
      airport.order_plane_to_takeoff plane
      expect(plane.status).to eq 'flying'
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Above is my delightful error.  At first I thought it was an issue with how I was `fail`ing or raising my error, but in hindsight now it's easy to see it was line 33 `planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }`.

The airport's maximum capacity was 6 so I was testing that a 7th plane landing would raise an error, the appropriate error!.  I kept getting the Runtime error instead.  Then I realised that the 'world' was cascading, so by that point there was already 6 planes landed and I didn't need to land another 6.
