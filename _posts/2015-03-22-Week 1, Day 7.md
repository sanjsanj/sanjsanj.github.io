Work continues on the Airport Challenge.  I'm mostly happy with my first iteration and am fairly confident about my code review tomorrow morning.  This was a an exercise is perfect syntax, brought to you by Rubocop.

Airport
  knows when a plane is in the air
  knows when a plane is in the airport
  can order a plane to take off
    should respond to #order_plane_takeoff
  can respond to a plane wanting to land
    should respond to #landing_permission
  traffic control
    a plane cannot land if the airport is full
  weather conditions
    can be both sunny and stormy
    a plane cannot land when it is stormy
    a plane cannot takeoff when it is stormy
Grand Finale
  6 planes can be created
  airport knows planes are in the air
  6 planes can land at specified airport
  airport knows planes are in the airport
  plane is denied landing permission when airport is full
  6 landed planes have status: landed
  after all 6 planes takeoff there are no more landed planes
  after all 6 planes takeoff their status is 'flying'
Plane
  has a 'flying' status when created
  is located in the air when created
  can 'request to land' at airport
  responds to 'land'
  has a status of 'landed' after landing
  does not respond to 'land' after landing
  responds to 'takeoff'
  can 'request to takeoff'
  changes its status to 'flying' after takeoff
  does not respond to 'takeoff' after takeoff

This afternoon our cohort had a Google Hangout, very useful to share knowledge amongst eachother.  I continue to learn a lot from everyone, today I learned that I'm an idiot, I don't even know to instantiate a class in IRB before calling its methods!
I could've sworn I knew that yesterday...
