Our coach for this week did a quick break-out session for us, explaining best practice for Object-Oriented design when tackling our takeaway-restaurant weekend challenge.  Very few people in our cohort had actually done it right and I'm sorry to say I definitely didn't.  So that'll be some out-of-hours work I'll have to re-do this week.  
Which is actually fine, we want to do it right and now we know how to do that.  
We were also assigned our weekly challenge, to create a web version of our battleships game.  
The application code was made in Ruby, of course, and originally tested with Rspec/Capybara.  But the web front end will be made in Sinatra and tested with Cucumber.  It's all very exciting, we're learning new languages!

  <% if @visitor %>  
    Hello, <%= @visitor %>!
  <% else %>
    <form action="/hello">
      My name is <%= @name %>.
      What's your name?
      <input type="text" name="name">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  <% end %>

Cucumber is a very robust testing application that is very light on the need to know code, you can program it almost entirely in plain English.  
The seniors I've spoken to about it say this week was really tough for them.  Personally I'm really looking forward to using something new and picking up some front-end web skills.
