So yesterday we started our weekend challenge.  Being able to apply our knowledge to a similar yet different real-world challenge so quickly is a great learning experience.
The plan of attack was to use the user-stories to come up with an outside-in, behaviour-driven design approach to coding, feature tests first, then unit tests, then watch them fail, then create the necessary application code to make them pass.
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'airport'
feature 'grand finale' do
  scenario 'all planes can land and all planes can take off' do
    airport = Airport.new
    planes = []
    6.times { planes << Plane.new  }
    planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 6
    airport.landed_planes.each do |plane|
      expect(plane.status).to eq 'landed'
    end
    planes.each_with_index do |plane|
      airport.request_plane_to_takeoff plane
    end
    expect(airport.airborne_planes.length).to eq 6
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 0
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
*(Watch me unjumble my unreadable and poorly designed Rspec/Ruby test code)*

One of the issues here, besides the functionality of what it's testing, is that the test code is simply unreadable.  All the tests that I intended at the time are there, but they need to be split up in to component parts.  This will also help isolaate the tests that aren't passing.
I think I've tried to do too much in too littile space and I need to get more comfortable with Rspec syntax.

Below is where my tests stood after some rethinking.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'airport'
feature 'Grand Finale' do
  airport = Airport.new
  planes = []
  6.times { planes << Plane.new }
  plane_7 = Plane.new

  scenario '6 planes can be created' do
    expect(planes.length).to eq 6
  end

  scenario '6 planes can land' do
    planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 6
  end

  scenario 'plane is denied landing permission when airport is full' do
    planes.each { |plane| airport.landing_permission plane }
    expect(airport.landing_permission plane_7).to eq 'permission denied'
  end

  scenario '6 landed planes have status: landed' do
    airport.landed_planes.each do |plane|
      expect(plane.status).to eq 'landed'
    end
  end

  scenario 'after all 6 planes takeoff there are no more landed planes' do
    planes.each do |plane|
      airport.order_plane_to_takeoff plane
    end
    expect(airport.landed_planes.length).to eq 0
  end

  scenario 'after all 6 planes takeoff their status is \'flying\'' do
    planes.each do |plane|
      airport.order_plane_to_takeoff plane
      expect(plane.status).to eq 'flying'
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

It's much better but there is a lot more to do.  Updates to follow.
