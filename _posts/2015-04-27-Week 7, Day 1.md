The juniors started at Makers today with a gentle introductory day of getting to meet their cohort and the team here, followed by an afternoon at the pub.  Menawhile, us seniors moved on to Angular and Node, needing to get a grasp of the languages very quickly so we can start working with APIs.  
The weekly project is a searchable github page pulling in their API, it's exciting new ground.  And we have new senior coaches so it's been pretty cool meeting them and learning some hardcore stuff.

Our lunchtime talk was an interesting one, many of the previous graduates have done their final projects using Beacons, and writing their own apps for it.  And Chris was an excellent and engaging speaker, and a thoroughly nice guy to speak to after his presentation.
