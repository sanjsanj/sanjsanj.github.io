Today the whole team was rearing to go, we want to get as much done as quickly as possible so we have time to troubleshoot and add extra functionality before the deadline next Friday.

We also finished off the rest of our planning, technologies and workflow.  After speaking to those who have gone before us we opted against AngularJS and instead going with pure Rails, we will no doubt have to be flexible if any golden opportunity arises.

We obviously needed a kanban board and ticket tracker so we decided to try [Waffle](www.waffle.io).  Below is where our board stood at the start of the day.

And next is where it stood at the end of the day.

We've also been putting our [Atomic.io](www.atomic.io) beta invites to good use to prototype the look and feel of our app.  Far too early to share with anyone but we're all excited about where we can go with this.

The team made great progress today but a personal challenge for me was setting up the omniauth Github login, it was painful, but it's done.
