This week is lab week, which means we are free to do what we want but still encouraged to pair or form small groups.  I've made some good plans to pair up with people I haven't had a chance to already.  
I intended to finish off the styling on my Bowling challenge but that didn't go according to plan either... sort of like yesterday!  
My original app design leaves a lot to be desired, I only started off meeting the minimum requirements, so when I wanted to get a lot more info out of the code to display on the front end I was out of luck.

So I spent most of the day jury-rigging some functions to do what I needed and I did some (seriously crappy) styling.  I'm going to focus on learning CSS this week and re-do the entire challenge this weekend with a bit more foresight into what I'll need at the end of the day.
