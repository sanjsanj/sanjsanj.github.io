Fresh from completing our 4-man hackathons we've been plunged into something even more terrifying, a 10-man assignment.  Even though we may never be in such a large team ever again it does give us a chance to encounter, overcome and anticipate similar problems in future.

The attitude of your teammates is more important than anything else, and once again I'm very happy with those that I've ended up with.  Next comes the organisation and focus on MVP, deciding on frameworks and how we're going to split our tasks.

We have half the team on backend and the other half (my half) on frontend.  The task is to create a web app to automatically create pairing matrixes for students/cohorts at Makers or anywhere else.
