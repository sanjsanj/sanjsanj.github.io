Today I've been playing around with CSS, I had a hard time getting my stylesheet to load but then discovered it was because the public folder had to be in the same folder as the server.rb .  I'm sure I could've configured it differently but my attempts proved unfruitful.  
Once that was sorted, I was in business.

Much more work can still be done on this, currently looking into how to use images to spruce the app up a little bit.  If I'm feeling brave I might try and make it multiplayer.  But I also want to get a look at next week's work and start it a bit early.
