Checking for the text contained in an input text box with Protractor feature tests proved to be a challenge for me.  
After trying by.id, by.class and by.model I started doubting myself and everything around me!  Then my good bud Andrea came to the rescue and helped me troubleshoot.  Apparently this is a webdriver quirk.  [Source](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/140#issuecomment-25654606)

>There's a weird webdriver quirk that getText() is always empty for<input> elements. Try doing userNameInput.getAttribute('value') instead.

In other news, I had my code review for my ToDo Challenge and got a clean sheet.  I've spoken a lot to my senior coach from this week before and he's a darned nice guy but this was my first professional interaction with him and it was awesome, I look forward to getting the most out of him this week.

At this stage I'm just starting to feel like I'm beginning to grasp AngularJS and Protractor, but no time to rest or stick to our comfort zones, it's on to Rails!

I'm also trying to become an Atom expert, courtesy of this spreadsheet:
