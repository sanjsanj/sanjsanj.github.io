Goodness me, I am knackered!  After sleeping off the excesses of Saturday night I got to work on the [takeaway-challenge](https://github.com/sanjsanj/takeaway-challenge) and boy, was it hard work.  
We were tasked with designing, testing and coding a takeaway system for a restaurant that could also send a delivery confirmation text, I didn't get nearly enough done on it so I'm not looking forward to my code review.  
One thing I can report, however, is that I found a far more elegant solution to printing out my menu:  
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def show_menu
  @menu.inject("") { |out, (dish, price)| out << "#{dish}: Â£#{price}\n" }
end
{% endhighlight %}  

<!--more-->  

My other achievement is getting Twilio to work and send texts on request:
