This day has not gone according to plan.  I expected to be done with the backend to support the frontend but I've had major issues getting the right information to display at the right time.  
It has definitely been a solid learning experience in getting Jquery to work and how to test properly in Jasmine.  I think I spent about half the day trying to get Jasmine to properly test my front-end.  It turns out it's becaue you have to load SpecRunner.html from localhost and not the file request.  

My buttons on the index.html:  

```html
<button id="btn0" type="button" class="btn btn-default" title="No pins knocked down" style="display: inline;">0</button>

etc... down to id="btn10"
```

And how I test for their presence in Jasmine-Jquery:  

```javascript
it('has buttons to enter pins scored', function(){
  for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i ++){
    expect('#btn' + i).toContain(i);
  };
});
```

I think I've broken and fixed code more times on this project than any other and it's annoying and enlightening me in equal quantities!

Tests that I'm passing so far:

```

    an illegal score

    two non-spare/non-strike rolls
    a strike and a spare
