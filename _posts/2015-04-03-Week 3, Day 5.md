Today I rolled out of bed at 9am, such a sweet, sweet treat.  I usually get up at 5.30am to catch the early train and beat the crowds, so a late start to the day is pure bliss.  
I had a quick look at the weekend challenge but don't intend to do much work today, I really want to unwind.  
I did play around in IRB and am happy to announce I've found many options that do not solve my problems.  I'll start the challenge tomorrow and update then, for now, excuse me while I go back to re-watching Interstellar.  
Happy Easter!
