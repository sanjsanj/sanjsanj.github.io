Yesterday the team came over to mine to work and it was a very long, but productive day.  We discovered some errors with multiuser authentication being saved properly to the database but managed to solve it by the end of the day.

In other news, I'm feeling a bit meta at the moment.  I feel like I'm able to reflect back upon the last ten weeks and am in awe of how far not only I, but everyone in my cohort have come.

I'm beginning to understand how important it really is to learn how to learn.  The bleeding edge is constantly changing and we have to adapt equally quickly in order to stay on the forefront of development.  I feel like I know so little about the tech that I use that I can't form a solid opinion on my favourites, and even if I did have favourites I should be comfortable being out of my comfort zone, adapting to the best solution for any given situation.

And my teamwork skills are getting better as well.  While it's nice to have a senior dev above you that can guide you effortlessly through to deployment sometimes we have to step in and power our team through ourselves.  Understanding each unit's strengths and weaknesses and giving them the scope and opportunity to push themselves beyond their limits is very important, only then can you truly get the best out of your team.
