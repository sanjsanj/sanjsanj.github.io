Work continued on our bookmark manager website projects today.  I had hoped to make a really slick front-end for it but that plan met with a lot of obstacles, first and foremost my lack of experience in html and CSS.  But that's not a problem, it's good I now know that's something I want and need to work on.  
We're made aware of the skills that employers look for and one thing that has come up a lot recently is our attitude toward work, and more importantly problems.  Keeping a cool head and remaining effective when the shit is hitting the fan and everything is going wrong is essential, I think I tick those boxes but again, that's something I need to work on improving.

The seniors are currently working on their final projects, some of them look absolutely amazing and it's hard to fathom how they can accomplish that much in short a short span of time.  At the end of next week they will be handing off on them and presenting them to us and the world, I will try and include tidbits here if I can.  
I'm also trying to actively get involved in a couple of their projects to get some experience of how they work.
