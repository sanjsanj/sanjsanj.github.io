Another little story from my escapades yesterday is about getting the Travis-CI build to pass on my pull request.  I got the following error:  
```
An error occurred while installing do_postgres (0.10.15), and Bundler cannot
continue.
```
Some searching turned up this:  
```
You should be able to solve this error by adding the following to your 
.travis.yml: 

before_install: 
  - sudo apt-get update -qq 
  - sudo apt-get install -qq postgresql-server-dev-9.3 

Replace 9.3 with the Postgres version being used (9.1 is the default, 
9.2 and 9.3 are also supported) 
```
from [Source](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/travis-ci/TJcCVfTR-eQ)  

That gave me another error:  
```
The command "bundle exec rspec spec" exited with 1.
0.71s$ bundle exec cucumber
No such file or directory - features. You can use `cucumber --init` to get started.
```
I hadn't written any Cucumber tests so I went back and deleted it from the Rakefile.  

More compelling tales of troublesooting after the break.
