Another little story from my escapades yesterday is about getting the Travis-CI build to pass on my pull request.  I got the following error:  

**An error occurred while installing do_postgres (0.10.15), and Bundler cannot
continue.**

Some searching turned up this:

**You should be able to solve this error by adding the following to your 
.travis.yml: 

before_install: 
  - sudo apt-get update -qq 
  - sudo apt-get install -qq postgresql-server-dev-9.3 

Replace 9.3 with the Postgres version being used (9.1 is the default, 
9.2 and 9.3 are also supported)**

from [Source](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/travis-ci/TJcCVfTR-eQ)  

That gave me another error:

**The command "bundle exec rspec spec" exited with 1.
0.71s$ bundle exec cucumber
No such file or directory - features. You can use `cucumber --init` to get started.**

I hadn't written any Cucumber tests so I went back and deleted it from the Rakefile.  

More compelling tales of troublesooting after the break.

**$ bundle exec rspec spec
/home/travis/build/makersacademy/chitter-challenge/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/data_objects-0.10.15/lib/data_objects/connection.rb:79:in `initialize': FATAL:  database "chitter_test" does not exist (DataObjects::ConnectionError)
The command "bundle exec rspec spec" exited with 1.**

Travis-CI needed to know where the test database was:

**Using PostgreSQL in your Builds #

The default user for accessing the local PostgreSQL server is postgres and doesn't have a password set up.

Creating a database for your application requires just an extra line in your .travis.yml:

before_script:
  - psql -c 'create database travis_ci_test;' -U postgres**

After that my Travis-CI debugging proglems were over.

**Coverage is at 100.0%.
Coverage report sent to Coveralls.
The command "bundle exec rspec spec" exited with 0.
Done. Your build exited with 0.**
