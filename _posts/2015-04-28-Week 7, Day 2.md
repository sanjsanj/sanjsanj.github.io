Angular and Node continues.  There is a bit of a learning curve to get to grips with the syntax and the peculiarities of the language but generally speaking I feel like the training has been good enough for us to pick up new languages with relative ease.  
Did an athletic restart of the Github user search web app, calling in the Git API, and it went ok.  There were a few obstacles yesterday with debugging and a few new obstacles today but calling in help from my fellow cohort soon solved them and by the afternoon I had a finished app ready for styling.

There's nothing all too impressive to show off with my actual backend yet, hopefully in the next couple of days I'll be making more complex API calls and will highlight them here.  
However, I am getting more comfortable with CSS and below is the totality of my styling for this app.

```javascript
body {
  background-color: #D9514E;
}

#image {
  position: absolute;
  max-width: 10%;
  top: 18px;
  left: 5%;
}

#title {
  font-size: 38px;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 35px;
  background-color: #383737;
  color: #D9514E;
}

.form-horizontal {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 258px;
  padding: 15px;
}

#avatar {
  width: 100px;
}

li {
  background-color: #383737;
  font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;
  font-size: 20px;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```
