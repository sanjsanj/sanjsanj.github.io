Predictably, not much to report today.  Batteries need recharging so I've done mostly a whole lot of nothing.

I did do some reading on WebGL last night and plan to do some tutorials on it tonight.  Or maybe I'll just play Diablo III instead, I'm so conflicted!

On a serious note I do want to clear my mind for a tough final week as a student at Makers.  It's hiring week and it helps us cover our CVs, prepare for tech tests and interviews and culminates in meeting some of the latest hiring partners.

I'm also genuinely quite excited about learning new stuff, or making sure I understood stuff we have already learnt.  Also looking forward to diving head-first into WebGL, it looks right up my alley.

I've been using [Learning WebGL](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217) and [WebGL Academy](http://www.webglacademy.com/)
