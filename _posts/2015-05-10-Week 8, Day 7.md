1 - I've now added image uploading functionality to the submit form and it works but I had to dig deep to find how to make it required before letting the form be submitted.  
The answer was not to meddle with the erb form but rather the model.  Add this line to your model.

```ruby
validates :image, :presence => true
```

How my form looks now.

```ruby
<%= form_for Image.new, html: {multipart: true} do |i| %>
  <%= i.label :description %>
  <%= i.text_field :description %>
  <%= i.file_field :image %>
  <%= i.submit "Upload" %>
<% end %>
```

And my model.

```ruby
class Image < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :likes, dependent: :destroy
  belongs_to :user

  has_attached_file :image, :styles => { :large => "600x600>", :medium => "300x300>", :thumb => "100x100>" }, :default_url => "/images/:style/missing.png"
  validates_attachment_content_type :image, :content_type => /\Aimage\/.*\Z/

  validates :image, :presence => true
end
```
