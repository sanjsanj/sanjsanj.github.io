More of my troubleshooting for this project after the break.

<!--more-->

--------

1 - I've now added image uploading functionality to the submit form and it works but I had to dig deep to find how to make it required before letting the form be submitted.   [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30149648/how-to-make-a-file-field-required-before-submit-in-erb-rails/30149708#30149708)  
The answer was not to meddle with the erb form but rather the model.  Add this line to your model.

```ruby
validates :image, :presence => true
```

How my form looks now.

```ruby
<%= form_for Image.new, html: {multipart: true} do |i| %>
  <%= i.label :description %>
  <%= i.text_field :description %>
  <%= i.file_field :image %>
  <%= i.submit "Upload" %>
<% end %>
```

And my model.

```ruby
class Image < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :likes, dependent: :destroy
  belongs_to :user

  has_attached_file :image, :styles => { :large => "600x600>", :medium => "300x300>", :thumb => "100x100>" }, :default_url => "/images/:style/missing.png"
  validates_attachment_content_type :image, :content_type => /\Aimage\/.*\Z/

  validates :image, :presence => true
end
```

2 - Testing image uploads

After requiring an image attachment before allowing users to submit a post I had loads of failing tests, so I set about solving them.  Firstly I had to create the `spec/fixtures/files` folder and put an image in it.

Then update my helper:

```ruby
def create_an_image file_path = "spec/fixtures/files/myface.jpg"
  visit '/images'
  click_link 'Upload Image'
  fill_in 'Description', with: 'My face'
  attach_file "Image", file_path  #<---- IMAGE ATTACHED HERE
  click_button 'Upload'
end
```

Which corresponds to the view:

```ruby
<%= form_for Image.new, html: {multipart: true} do |i| %>
  <%= i.label :description %>
  <%= i.text_field :description %>
  <%= i.label :image %>
  <%= i.file_field :image %>
  <%= i.submit "Upload" %>
<% end %>
```

Now my tests pass again and I can write a new test to make sure the post fails without an attachment:

```ruby
scenario 'they must attach an image' do
  visit '/'
  click_link 'Upload Image'
  fill_in 'Description', with: 'My face'
  click_button 'Upload'
  expect(page).not_to have_content 'My face'
 end
```

3 - Styling.  When better to start styling than before your app is even halfway complete!  I'm using a Bootstrap template called [Paper](http://bootswatch.com/paper/) and its built-in classes to style my site.

4 - In order to make my thumbnails redirect to the image's dedicated page I had to change:

```
<%= link_to image_tag image.image.url(:thumb) %>
```

To:

```
<%= link_to image_tag(image.image.url(:thumb)), image_path(image) %>
```
