Today we were issued our weekend challenge, to create a web version of a working rock-paper-scissors game.  This will reinforce all our practice with Sinatra this week, and undoubtedly show the chinks in our armor.  
Thankfully it's a long weekend due to Easter, so we have 4 days before we have to hand it in, and I'm not feeling particularly cofident about it at the moment.  
The good news, however is that I've caught up on passing last weekend's challenge.  My coach this week is a thorough coder and an excellent person to learn from, he showed me exactly how poor my design was before and how to use Single Responsibility Principles, Dependency Inject and Inversion to create a masterpiece in Ruby.  
Follow me after the break to see my passing test in all their glory.
