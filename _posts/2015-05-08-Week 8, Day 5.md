Our weekend challenge is to recreate [Instagram](https://instagram.com) using Rails.  The deviation from what we've been learning this week is to add images so my pair partner and I spent the day creating a new app that just allows uploading images to get to grips with the process.

We're also tasked with using Amazon Web Services to host the images, it apparently has a steep learning curve but is an essential part of our training because of its widespread use.

But, we've been working hard, so we need to play hard too.  The beers came out of the fridge in the early afternoon, followed by gin and tonics at the local tapas place and a pizza and more beer for dinner.  Which means I haven't done anything on the challenge yet, but I will tomorrow, promise.
