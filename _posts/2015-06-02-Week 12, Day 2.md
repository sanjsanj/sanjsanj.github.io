Nothing fun to report today.  I want to be coding but I'm doing admin.  Unfortunately we have to go through the business of cleaning up our git repos and preparing our CVs.

I did encounter an issue with getting an accurate CodeClimate report on one of our repos.

The issue is CodeClimate trying to assess local Javascript libraries.  To avoid that, create a `.codeclimate.yml` file in your root and put the following exclusions in it:

```
exclude_paths:
 - "public/assets"
```

That worked in our specific case but your mileage may vary, a more common exclusion would be as follows:

```
exclude_paths:
 - "lib/jasmine-2.2.0/jasmine.js"
 - "lib/jasmine-2.2.0/jasmine-jquery.js"
 - "lib/jasmine-2.2.0/jasmine-html.js"
```
