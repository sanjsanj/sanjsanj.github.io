The next two days are Makerthon, sort of like a hackathon but more makery.  We start the day pitching projects and forming groups then quickly jump into making things happen.

The team I got on is making an app called Gym Buddy, to let people find suitable people to go to the gym with or make new friends doing so.

We're using Rails to scaffold the creation of the app and doing everything test-driven with Rspec/Capybara.

The coding is not the challenge here, rather the managing of workflow between the team, identifying MVPs, setting up kanban boards, branching repositories, managing merge conflicts and communicating well with eachother!

The day just flew right by and before we knew it it was past 9pm.  Luckily we had most of our MVP in place.

Having now done it I feel the process is a lot less scary and I feel infinitely more prepared for final project at Makers and working on projects in the real world.
