For the next two weeks we'll be doing final projects.  Our 4-man team was given an initial brief for a website to store and display code tutorials and resources with ratings but we've been let off the leash to expand or modify the idea to be what we want it to be.

Feature creep is something we all want to avoid and today was mostly spent in discussions amongst ourselves and with the coaches to try and pin down an MVP.

As it stands we're going to mutate the idea to incorporate something the internal engineering team is planning to work on, a dispensary of tutorials and other resources for Makers students.

First we brainstormed ideas for what the app could do then narrowed it down to the best, then created a survey for students past and present to fill out to let us know what they actually wanted.  That allowed us to really distill the MVP down to something doable and something that would actually be beneficial to our audience.
